Overview ðŸŒŸðŸ“š
Welcome to the Anime Recommendation System! This project aims to provide personalized anime recommendations based on collaborative filtering techniques.

The application utilizes user-based collaborative filtering to find similar users based on their anime preferences and recommends animes liked by similar users that the target user has not watched yet. Additionally, the system employs item-based collaborative filtering to find similar animes based on their features (e.g., genres, synopsis) and recommends animes similar to the one provided by the user.

The dataset used for training and recommendation includes various anime titles, user ratings, and anime features such as genres and synopses. The model was trained using TensorFlow and Keras to create anime embeddings for both users and animes, facilitating efficient similarity comparisons.

Feel free to explore and enjoy the exciting world of anime recommendations with our innovative system!
